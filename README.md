# BookManage
My first repository on GitHub. X )  It's a newcomer (:cow: :beer:).

emm,it seems that i shouldn't upload the 'project' here...  whatever,it's the first thing i upload 

it's a simplified version of library management system(a piece of shit :)  ),
for me to learn the simple use of controls

There are several functions：
book borrowing、book return and renewal、book Search、
(Administrator rights)add books to library、(Administrator rights)update the information about books.
